Matthew's About Me


My name is Matthew Escalera, I am from New York, where I am currently trying to build a career in Cyber Security. I am currently a fellow at the knoweledge house where I chose the course of Cyber Security. I chose this path because it aligns with my interests when it comes to tech and what will be one of the gems in terms of knoweledge in the future. I first was interested in Tech from movies and shows which really astounded me and what I can do, make, and build with a computer and with my hands. My interests align mostly in the tech industry where it led me to cyber security, and hopefully more amounts of knoweledge later in my career. My goal is really trying to align my careers that I'm trying to get into with my future ambitions and I believe this is the first step towards that

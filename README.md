Matthew's About Me


My name is Matthew Escalera, I am from New York, where I am currently trying to build a career in Cyber Security. I am currently a fellow at the knoweledge house where I chose the course of Cyber Security. I chose this path because it aligns with my interests when it comes to tech and what will be one of the gems in terms of knoweledge in the future. I first was interested in Tech from movies and shows which really astounded me and what I can do, make, and build with a computer and with my hands. My interests align mostly in the tech industry where it led me to cyber security, and hopefully more amounts of knoweledge later in my career. My goal is really trying to align my careers that I'm trying to get into with my future ambitions and I believe this is the first step towards that 

What Is Cloud Computing?

Cloud computing is a Skyrocketing Ecosystem Transforming the Technology Landscape.
Cloud computing is a delivery of computing services including servers, storage, databases,
networking, software, analytics, and intelligence over the Internet. Today, cloud technology
means that companies can scale and adapt at speed and scale, accelerate innovation, drive
business agility, streamline operations, and reduce costs. Before Cloud Computing, businesses
had to store all their data and software on their own hard drives and servers. This isn’t scalable
because if you think about how big the company is, it would mean more storage and that would
make the servers crash because it's too much. Three different components of cloud computing
have to do with the servers, etc. The servers are virtual (not physical) servers in a cloud
computing environment that can be accessed by an unlimited amount of users. Cloud servers
work the same as physical servers when it comes to storing data and running applications. In
cloud computing there are three different cloud computing service models which are SaaS, PaaS,
IaaS. IaaS is a customized infrastructure that is provided by the cloud provider so that the
customer can run any operating system or application. Out of all the three, it is the most flexible
because it gives the customer almost total control of their infrastructure. PaaS is a model that
provides a virtualized application development platform without the need to furnish hardware or
in-house resources and all necessary components and development services are provided by the
CSP(communication service providers). SaaS offers customers direct, online access to
applications without any of the challenges of maintaining them, their platform, or infrastructure.
Cloud computing gives business flexibility. Businesses will be able to scale resources quickly
and storage up to meet business demands without having to invest in physical infrastructure.
Companies don’t need to pay for or build the infrastructure needed to support their highest load
levels. When it comes to cost-saving, you only pay for the resources you actually use. This helps
you avoid overbuilding and overprovisioning your data center. Cloud computing provides
businesses with the opportunity to significantly reduce costs and improve efficiency. Traditional
IT infrastructure requires a large amount of capital investment for hardware, software licenses,
and maintenance. In contrast, cloud computing allows businesses to access resources on-demand,
paying only for what they use. With cloud technology organizations can now collaborate more
effectively because cloud-based tools such as document sharing and real-time communication,
teams can work together in a virtual environment, breaking down barriers of time and location.
Some examples of cloud services have to do with Amazon Web Services (AWS) which is
designed to allow application providers to quickly and securely host your applications. Microsoft
Azure which is a public cloud computing platform that provides a broad range of cloud services,
including compute, analytics, storage and networking. Google Cloud offers services for compute,
storage, networking, big data, machine learning and IoT, as well as cloud management, security
and developer tools. Cloud-based platforms enable large enterprise businesses to build, test and
deploy applications, and store, back up, and recover data.
